Timeline
--------

 * Start with the "WPILib Installation Guide" mentioned above.
   Read the Software manual. Read all of it until "Advanced programming".
   May skip the details about LabVIEW, python, C++ since we're using Java.
   Glance throught the Advanced programming section to at least know
   what's in there.
